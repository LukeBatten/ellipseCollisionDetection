# ellipseCollisionDetection
Determines if 2 ellipses collide/overlap using a simple approach.

The final mathematical criteria is used from Etayo et al., 2006;
A new approach to characterizing the relative position of two ellipses depending on one parameter:

Two programs exist in this repository:
> a ROOT CERN C++ file

> a Mathematica notebook

Each program determines if 2 ellipses overlap, or not, and then sketches the results.
