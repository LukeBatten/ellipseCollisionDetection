# ellipseCollisionDetection
Determines if 2 ellipses collide/overlap using a simple approach.

The final mathematical criteria is used from Etayo et al., 2006;
A new approach to characterizing the relative position of two ellipses depending on one parameter:

> a ROOT CERN C++ file
> a Mathematica notebook

Both programs determine if ellipses overlap, or not, and sketches the results.
